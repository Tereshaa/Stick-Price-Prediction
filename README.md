# Stock-Price Prediction


## Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for my data analytics project in a Kaggle hackathon, where the goal was to predict stock prices and develop a strategy (Hold, Buy, or Sell) based on historical data.

 I achieved the 32nd position out of 274 participants on the Kaggle leaderboard for this hackathon.

## Project Highlights
### Stock Price Prediction ('Close' Column):

Model Used: Linear Regression 

Additional Note: Experimentation with ARIMA was conducted initially, but linear regression outperformed it.

### Strategy Prediction:

Ensemble Learning Techniques:

Base Model: XGBoost

Final Prediction: Soft Voting among ensemble models.


## To run the code and reproduce the results:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open the Kaggle notebook for step-by-step analysis.

Review the code and comments for a detailed understanding of the data preprocessing and modeling process.

Execute the notebooks to generate predictions for the 'Close' and 'Strategy' columns.
